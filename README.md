# RoleplayingVoiceCore

Responsible for allowing sending/receiving/and playback of various audio sources via a seperately hosted server.
This core has support for elevenlabs, voice pack syncronization, spatial audio, twitch support, and VLC playback.

For an example of how Roleplaying Voice Core is used see how its implemented for Dalamud, a Final Fantasy XIV plugin ecosystem:

This core could in theory be used for other games if implemented correctly.

Roleplaying Voice Core uses the following repository for managing server interactions
